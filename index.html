    <p style="color: white;font-size:large; font-weight: bolder;text-align: justify;"> 
        Over the course of two weeks, I played a significant role in the creation of three short films. As part of the process, I took on multiple responsibilities, including direction, screenplay writing, sound effects, music composition, cinematography, choreography, and editing. In addition to carrying out these tasks, I also worked closely with my junior colleagues, guiding and teaching them about the art of filmmaking. Together, we achieved our goal and received recognition for our efforts in the form of awards. It was a fantastic experience to work as a team and lead the way towards our shared vision.

        <p style="color: white;font-size:large; font-weight: bolder;text-align: justify;"> The Song "Un Pirivin Vali" is my song about the pain of a boy's love and the song concept covers sad emotional lyrics. I have composed drop-beat music for this track. The song is recorded and edited in FL Studio. The mastering process involved the sound adjustment of volume EQ and compressions like adding Fades, Cross Fades, and other final touch modulations with a polished sound as a final output. The song is sung and composed by me.
