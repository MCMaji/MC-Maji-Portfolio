    <h3>HI THERE !</h3>
    <h1>I'M <span>Abdul Majeed (MC Maji)</span></h1>
    <p>My passion for music is based on contemporary social themes. I express my thematic content through emotions, which are reflected by today's youngsters.<br>
        Music is a universal art, which needs professional and technical support. In the past, it was only the raw talent without any technological innovations. Even the musical instruments were not electronic. Technology has always been a boon, and the field of music has benefited much from it as well.

        <p style="color: white;font-size:large; font-weight: bolder;text-align: justify;"> The Song "Un Pirivin Vali" is my song about the pain of a boy's love and the song concept covers sad emotional lyrics. I have composed drop-beat music for this track. The song is recorded and edited in FL Studio. The mastering process involved the sound adjustment of volume EQ and compressions like adding Fades, Cross Fades, and other final touch modulations with a polished sound as a final output. The song is sung and composed by me.
